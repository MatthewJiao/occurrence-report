## Description 
This is an incident/occurrence reporting platform for activities involving drones operating under the Airmatrix system. 

## Example Use Case
In example, if a drone was to crash, the operator would then log onto the platform () with their credientials and file a report detailing the incident. When the report is submitted, it will get sent to Transport Canada's database.

## Notes
The code which I've made public is only implemented halfway. Authentication has been stripped from this version as well.

## Available Scripts
In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm i`

then run 

### `npm start`
